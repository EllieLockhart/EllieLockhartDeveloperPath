# Ellie Lockhart's Path to Becoming a Software Developer

This personal organizer/journal records Ellie Lockhart's achievement of milestones in her path to becoming a data scientist and software developer.

## Project Journal
- August 2020: initiate study; begin GitHub commits on regular basis; contribute to existing open source projects (documentation, etc); formulate main projects (movie research, video game research, React or Express-based pseudo-Twine implementation)
     - 08/16/2020: (Movie Financial Data Project) Upon being interviewed on manually collected data analysis about movie finances, begin work on a Python-based project to obtain, organize, and annotate information on movie financials to compare similarly themed movies and their financial success rates
     - 08/27/2020: (Movie Financial Data Project) Begin studying ways to scrape Twitter for movie-related sentiment analysis; can also be cross-applied to video game sentiment analysis, and may be moved to this project overall
- September 2020: work with data science; read books; conduct actual web scraping
    - 09/03/2020: (OSS Contributions, General Data Science) Commit documentation updates to trifalatura scraping library; read about broad data science processes and applications
    - 09/05/2020: (General React.js)
    - 09/08/2020: (OSS Contributions) Continue making commits to resources in the OSS community, particularly the MagicTools game development resources repository
    - 09/11/2020: (Video Game ML project) Begin work developing a Newspaper3k/BeautifulSoup scraping algorithm for obtained Metacritic user reviews for sentiment analysis
    - 09/14/2020: (Video Game ML project) Successfully scrape user and critic reviews for one entry on MetaCritic using previous scraping program; Python script should be usable for the movie data analysis project once it is adapted to work with RottenTomatoes
    - 09/15/2020: (Movie Financial Data Mapping Project) Set up a PostgreSQL server locally; familiarize self with cloud solutions including AWS, IBM Cloud, and Azure
    - 09/17/2020: (Movie Financial Data Mapping Project, Video Game ML Project) Begin import of raw data into PostgreSQL
## Project Goals
### Video Game Marketing/Sentiment Analysis
- [ ] Develop a scraping algorithm for review sites **partial!**
- [X] Develop a scraping algorithm for Metacritic
- [X] Develop scripts to clean data for neural network/sentiment analysis
- [X] Develop scriprs to put data objects into a local or cloud database (preferably MongoDB) **PostgreSQL for now**
- [ ] Develop scripts to perform neural network/sentiment analysis
- [ ] Publish findings and/or set up a demo site
### Movie Data/Financial Analysis
- [X] Manually collect preliminary results
- [X] Construct graphs from preliminary results to show preliminary findings
- [X] Do interview about preliminary findings
- [X] Develop a solution for importing IMDb raw data from official IMDb website into an SQL database
- [ ] Supplement that data with additional data to support research questions
- [ ] Develop a scraping algorithm for a reliable source of movie financial data (i.e. imdB)
- [ ] Develop a scraping algorithm for a reliable source of audience attitude data (i.e. RottenTomatoes) **NOTE: Rotten Tomatoes is *very* hard to scrape!** **In progress**
- [ ] Compare preliminary dataset with wider dataset based on financial information
- [ ] Find attitude-based analysis data for both data sets
- [ ] Present/publish findings
### Build a database for media marketing and academic research

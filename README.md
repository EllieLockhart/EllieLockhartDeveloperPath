# Ellie Lockhart's Path to Becoming a Software Developer

This personal organizer/journal records Ellie Lockhart's achievement of milestones in her path to becoming a data scientist and software developer.

## Project Journal
- August 2020: initiate study; begin GitHub commits on regular basis; contribute to existing open source projects (documentation, etc); formulate main projects (movie research, video game research, React or Express-based pseudo-Twine implementation) - **COMPLETED**
- September 2020: work with data science; read books; conduct actual web scraping
    - 09/03/2020: (OSS Contributions, General Data Science) Commit documentation updates to trifalatura scraping library [SUBMITTED]; read about broad data science processes and applications - **COMPLETED**
    - 09/05/2020: (General React.js) - **ONGOING**
    - 09/08/2020: (OSS Contributions) Continue making commits to resources in the OSS community, particularly the MagicTools game development resources repository - **COMPLETED** **ONGOING**
    - 09/11/2020: (Video Game ML project) Begin work developing a Newspaper3k/BeautifulSoup scraping algorithm for obtained Metacritic user reviews for sentiment analysis - **ONGOING AS OF THIS LOGGED TIME PERIOD**
    - 09/14/2020: (Video Game ML project) Successfully scrape user and critic reviews for one entry on MetaCritic using previous scraping program; Python script should be usable for the movie data analysis project once it is adapted to work with RottenTomatoes **COMPLETED**
